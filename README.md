# Windows Active Directory Lab
Through the Windows and Active Directory room on TryHackMe, I’ve developed a foundational understanding of how Active Directory (AD) operates within a Windows environment. This hands-on lab introduced me to essential AD components such as domains, organizational units, group policy, Kerberos authentication, and user/group management. I gained experience with enumeration techniques, common misconfigurations, and practical exploitation tools that simulate real-world scenarios. This knowledge is highly relevant for roles in IT support and systems administration, as Active Directory is a core technology for managing users, computers, and access across enterprise networks. Documenting this lab allows me to reinforce what I’ve learned and demonstrate my technical growth in a structured and professional way.
